<h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>
<p>The sites for <a href="http://www.squarespace.com">Squarespace</a> and <a href="http://www.mailchimp.com">MailChimp.</a></p>
<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size, or balance?</h2>
<p>
The <a href="http://www.squarespace.com">Squarespace</a> site utilizes space effectively in that the home page does not have a long scrolling page like so many sites do. Also, 
the balance of the home page is effective in that the nav bar at the top right only has 3 buttons with the menu button having the hamburger icon where you can click on it and it has a drop down of the remaining page options.
</p>
The <a href="http://www.mailchimp.com">Mailchimp</a> home page is similar to Squarespace's in that it doesn't require the user to scroll down it. The negative space is effective in that it allows the user to focus on what they need to accomplish and I like the javascript effects that show you how their enewsletters operate without having to watch videos.
</p>
<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>
<p>
The <a href="http://www.squarespace.com">Squarespace</a> site and <a href="http://www.mailchimp.com">Mailchimp</a> site both limit the amount of information on their home pages which I like instead of overburdening you with information. The Squarespace site utilizes the popular hamburger icon to allow the user to click on the page they'd like to navigate to. Some do not like this icon or are unaware of what it is but I think its effective since a lot of sites use this type of format with responsive design when the page is minimized to the mobile size and shows this hamburger icon effect.

<h2>Thumbnail sketches</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Home Page</strong></li>
I am utilizing a lot of negative space in this home page sketch to draw the user to the carousel of images that would highlight services of my company.  The images are the focal point of this page. The flow would be from the carousel of images to the calendar of events that will be displayed on the right side.

<li><strong>Products Page</strong></li>
The products page is similar to the home page to maintain consistency so the users know where to look for information. I would have product content instead of large images so the user can learn about each of our products. A video can be displayed as well if the user so chooses to watch one. I want to change up the flow between the product content and how the video displays but need to think about how I want to do that. The calendar of events will be on each page to advertise our upcoming training events.
